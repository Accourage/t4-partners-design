# Potential Business Partners

Accourage's business partners will primarily consist of our users, since the Accourage app is designed to connect providers with consumers.
Accourage will grow as a business according to the growth of our customer segment. The more providers using the Accourage app, the more 
we have to offer to the consumers. Here are a few examples of potential business partners that could team up with Accourage:

## Home Improvement Providers
One potential provider that could use Accourage are home improvers. These providers could fall under many different job specialties including
painters, plumbers, electricians, gardners, etc.  An independent handyman can offer to work on a customer's home through the Accourage app. 
This benefits both the provider and Accourage, allowing for the growth of our business as well as the provider's business. Furthermore, 
Accourage could team up with larger companies that specialize in home improvement. Local businesses would be able to advertise their services
and reach out to customers through the Accourage app, benefiting both parties in the process.

## Carpenters
Another potential service provider that could use Accourage would be carpenters. These workers could build custom furnature for people based on what they need. This is a benefit to the carpenter because Accourage offers him/her a platform to find customers. This is also a benefit to the customer because they can find carpenters. Carpenters would be a valuable business partner for Accourage because carpenters give Accourage a special market. Accourage would be one of the only places to find someone who will do a small job for you. Everyone benefits from this business partner.

## Fast Food
The business partner that can help Accourage online business get started and grow is Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A is a fast-food chain
business with over 1,900 locations spread across the U.S. this business makes a great partner for the Accourage online business, because 
it provides the relevant goods that Accourage seeks to deliver to customers. Chick-fil-A is a viable business partner because the food
chain business has already identified the need to have a convenient, speedy and reliable delivery service for its customers, and is
currently partnering with a post-mate competitor to deliver its products to customers in 1,100 of its locations. Therefore, Accourage 
should partner with Chick-fil-A and offer it a delivery service connectivity that will cover the rest of Chick-fil-A’s 800 store locations 
that lack access to such convenient delivery services. 

The partnership between Chick-fil-A and Accourage can be instrumentally beneficial to both businesses. On the one hand, Chick-fil-A’s 
business is negatively affected by the long customer waiting lines especially during the peak hours. The problem is especially significant
for the Chick-fil-A customers who have limited time for lunch and wants to grab a bite before resuming to the office. Therefore, the 
provision of a delivery service that can allow the fast-food chain to deliver customer orders to their offices or places of work would be 
highly beneficial to Chick-fil-A. On the other hand, Accourage is in the business of connecting businesses with their customers, through 
providing a fast and reliable delivery service. Thus, Accourage would serve the Chick-fil-A’s interest better, through providing the 
fast-food chain with connectivity to delivery services from around its 1,900 locations. The connectivity will then ensure that Chick-fil-A
is able to have its products delivered to its customers on demand and without delays, thus being able to sustain the customer loyalty and 
expand its business even more.
